    <h1>Thinking Inside the Box</h1>
    <p class="description">
        When you are styling a web page with CSS you
        must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each element is treated as if it generates a new box. Each box can have
        new rules associated with it.
    </p>
    <img src="Pictures/Amdaris.png" />
    <p>
        As you can see from the diagram above, each box has a <b>border</b>.
        Between the content and the border you can have <b>padding</b>, and
        outside of the border you can have a <b>margin</b> to separate this box
        from any neighboring boxes.
