    <p>There are three ways to use styles in a web page. The first approach is to embed style information directly into an element using the style attribute. This is convenient, but it clutters the markup terribly. You have to style every line, one by one. The second approach is to embed an entire style sheet in a style element, which you must place in the page’s head section. This code separates the formatting from your web page markup but still keeps everything together in one file. This approach makes sense for one-off formatting tasks (when you don’t want to reuse your formatting choices in another page), and it’s a good choice for simple tests and examples. However, it’s not so great for a real-world, professional website, because it leads to long, bloated pages. The third approach is to link to a separate style sheet file by adding a link element to the head section. This approach is the most common and the most powerful. It gives you the flexibility to reuse your styles in other pages. If you want, you can further divide your styles into multiple style sheets and link to as many as you need in any HTML page. </p >
